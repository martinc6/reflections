It was interesting to see such a rapid debugging tool.  Tom and I
have spent far too long hunting for a single typo in our code.
This is a terriffic tool to help speed up our dev-process. 

I think one of the things we really need to figure out is a 
work flow system.  I know about SCURM and such, but we really need
the basics, like version control, feature mapping, product dev
roadmapping, etc.

I suppose this is all par for the course in a startup, eh?

This is just an example of using subl with git.
