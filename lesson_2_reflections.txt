Creating repositories allows me to maintain 'containers' of code.

For instance I can bundle together little projects, or even seperate features, which
then can be merged with a larger branch, or not.

IE: the bacon site could have been it's own repository, allowing Tom and I to both access the site, and work on whatever parts we need to.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It seems that the staging area is mainly designed as a holding tank, to help keep track of moving parts, but before you're ready to commit.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

So it makes sense to work on things, one problem or task at a time.  I suppose once you finish something, add it to the staging area, then push the commit up, to save your work.
